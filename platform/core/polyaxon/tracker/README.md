Tracker aims at collecting usage information about Polyaxon clusters.
This information will help the Polyaxon development team to understand what people are doing with it,
and to make it a better product.

Note: Tracker does not report any personal identifiable information (PII).
Anything that might be identifying, including IP addresses, container images, and object names are anonymized.
We take this very seriously.
If you think something we are collecting might be considered PII, please do let us know by raising an issue here.

Running Tracker is a voluntary effort, in other words: it operates on an opt-in basisâ€”if you don't want to run it, you don't have to.

What will we do with this information?
The information reported by Tracker, in aggregate,
will help the Polyaxon development teams prioritize our efforts.
The better we understand what people are doing, the better we can focus on the important issues.
