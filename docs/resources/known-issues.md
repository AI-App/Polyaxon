The content of this page is intended to keep users up-to-date about the issues, limitations, bugs fixed, WIP, or still unsolved in a given version.

Every bug fixed will be mentioned here with a link to github, if available, and an updated status, i.e. fixes for known issues in 0.5 series and that will be available in 0.6 series.

> N.B. this page does not intend to list every github issue, but only those that impact a stable usage of the platform.
