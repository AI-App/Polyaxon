You can use Azure to manage your organizationâ€™s entire membership.

## Register a Microsoft Azure application

You need to register a [new application on Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

You should provide a callback URL: [Domain/IP]/oauth/azure

## Update Azure configuration on the settings page

You can now use your client id and secret token to set auth with Azure. In Polyaxon's dashboard on the settings page under `Auth`, you can set the values for `Azure`.
