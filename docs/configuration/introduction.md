For self-hosted Polyaxon users, a custom configuration file can be used to override Polyaxon's default behaviour. 
These guides provide you with a range of options to configure your deployment to suit your needs.

## Overview

Starting form Polyaxon v0.5.0 we recommend using `polyaxon-cli` for deploying Polyaxon. 
There are some configuration options which are required and many other that are optional.

The following articles in this section explain how to use the `cli` to create config deployment, 
as well as walk you through some of the important config options, like database, storage, notifications, ...

## Deploying Polyaxon

In order to deploy Polyaxon, you will need to create a `config.yaml`. 
 * To validate the deployment file: `polyaxon admin deploy -f config.yaml --check`
 * To do a dry run: `polyaxon admin deploy -f config.yaml --dry_run`
 * To install: `polyaxon admin deploy -f config.yaml`

Please visit the [setup](/setup/) page to learn more about how you can setup a Polyaxon deployment.

## Applying configuration changes

The general method to modify your Polyaxon deployment is to:

 1. Make a change to the `config.yaml`
 2. Run `polyaxon admin upgrade -f config.yaml --check`
 3. Run `polyaxon admin upgrade -f config.yaml`
 4. Wait for the upgrade to finish, and make sure that when you do
    `kubectl --namespace=<NAMESPACE> get pod` the pods are in Ready state.
    Your configuration change has been applied!
