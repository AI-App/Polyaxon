## Overview

This section provides short articles on common questions and scenarios that users of Polyaxon face when authoring their manifests.
In this section, we also include guides that describe recurrent use-cases and best practices for working with Polyaxon and for taking advantage of your Kubernetes cluster(s).

 * This section does not intend to provide a tutorial for getting started with Polyaxon, for that we suggest the [quick-start section](/docs/intro/quick-start/).
 * For in-depth documentation on using specific interfaces or tools, we suggest looking at the [references page](/docs/references/).
 * When several guides and how-tos are semantically related, we publish them as an independent section, for example:
   * [the scheduling strategies](/docs/core/scheduling-strategies/).
   * [the deployment strategies](/docs/setup/deployment-strategies/).
