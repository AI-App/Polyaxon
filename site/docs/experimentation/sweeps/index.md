## Overview

[Polytune](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/tree/master/core/polyaxon/polytune) 
is a library to dynamically find the best set of hyperparameter values that will minimize or maximize a particular metric.
It's based on open-source work and algorithms that you can customize and control. 
Polytune can make suggestions for hyperparameter values to try sequentially or in parallel (or both).


## Features
 
 * Easy-to-use: Polytune is an open-source Python library, it's lightweight, and can be used with the rest of your packages. 
 * Flexibility: It's customizable and provides several built-in distributions and algorithms. 
 * Total control: You can start experiments programmatically, you can use your own scheduler, and you control how many experiments to start and when to end them.
