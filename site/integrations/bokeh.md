You can log and consume charts generated by [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) directly to Polyaxon.

## Tracking

You can log any chart generated by Bokeh using [Polyaxon's tracking module](/docs/experimentation/tracking/module/#log_bokeh_chart).

## Dashboard

Any chart that is logged during the lifetime of your jobs or experiments can be rendered automatically in [Polyaxon UI](/docs/experimentation/visualizations/custom/#bokeh).

## In notebooks

You can also consume any events or charts tracked in your experiments using the Python Library to [programmatically](/docs/experimentation/visualizations/programmatic/#single-run) visualize results in notebooks.

## Downloading events

All charts and events are stored on your artifacts store, and follow any networking or security policy you set for your cluster. 
You can download any chart tracked to either render it manually or to archive it to a different location using the [Python Library](/docs/core/python-library/run-client/#get_events)
