You can use GitLab to manage your organizationâ€™s entire membership.

## Register a GitLab application

You need to register a [new application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/integration/oauth_provider.html) on GitLab.

![gitlab-integration1](../../content/images/integrations/sso/gitlab.png)

You should provide a callback URL: [Domain/IP]/oauth/gitlab

## Update GitLab configuration on the settings page

You can now use your client id and secret token to set auth with GitLab. In Polyaxon's dashboard on the settings page under `Auth`, you can set the values for `GitLab`.

![gitlab-settings](../../content/images/integrations/sso/gitlab-settings.png)

> N.B. The Gitlab Url is only required if you have an on-premise Gitlab installation.
