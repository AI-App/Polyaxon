You can GitHub to manage your organizationâ€™s entire membership.

## Register a GitHub application

You need to register a [new application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) on github.

You should provide a callback URL: [Domain/IP]/oauth/github

## Update Github configuration on the settings page

You can now use your client id and secret token to set auth with Github. In Polyaxon's dashboard on the settings page under `Auth`, you can set the values for `Github`.
