Polyaxon core engine is open source, has an Json API, webhooks, and an abstraction for creating components, and can be integrated with just about any other app or service.

## Components

Polyaxon provides an interface for authoring reusable [components](/docs/core/specification/), 
users can contribute to the public [components registry](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-hub/) 
or create private components for their own internal use.

## Integrations with the API/SDKs

Polyaxon provides a [Json API](/docs/api/) and a set of language [SDKs](/docs/references/#client-libraries) 
that users can leverage for integrating Polyaxon with other systems or automation tools. 

## API+Webhooks integrations

Polyaxon also supports custom API integrations which can be authenticated with individual keys, 
and deliver outgoing [webhooks](/docs/references/polyaxon-webhooks/) based on particular events.
