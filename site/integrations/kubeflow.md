Polyaxon provides native support for several KubeFlow components.

## Overview

 1. Kubeflow Operators:
    Polyaxon can schedule and manage Kubeflow operators natively. Polyaxon provides uniform workflow for:
     * Viewing logs and resources.
     * Tracking metrics, outputs, and models.
     * Comparing and driving insights.
    All Kubeflow jobs can be compared and composed natively with other operations supported by Polyaxon.
 2. Kubeflow Pipelines:
    Polyaxon supports Kubeflow Pipeline components with very few changes.
 3. Kubeflow KFServing:
    Polyaxon provides reusable components that can deploy models using KFServing.
      
## Deploying Kubeflow operators

For teams not running/using Kubeflow and want to use this integration, 
Polyaxon provides [Helm charts](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-charts/tree/master/kubeflow) for the Kubeflow operators currently supported.

These Helm charts will be maintained and supported by Polyaxon to allow users to deploy and manage Kubeflow Operators in an easy way.

 * [TFJob](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-charts/tree/master/kubeflow/tfjob)
 * [PytorchJob](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-charts/tree/master/kubeflow/pytorchjob)
 * [MPIJob](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-charts/tree/master/kubeflow/tfjob)
 
These operators require Helm to be installed, you can have a look at this guide to [setup Helm](/docs/guides/setup-helm/)

We are also distributing these charts directly on our official charts repo [https://charts.polyaxon.com](https://charts.polyaxon.com)

```bash
$ helm repo add polyaxon https://charts.polyaxon.com
$ helm repo update
```

## Deploying/Deleting TFJob

In order to use Kubeflow as backend for running [distributed Tensorflow experiments](/integrations/tfjob/), 
you need to deploy TFJob on the same namespace where Polyaxon was deployed

```bash
helm install polyaxon/tfjob --name=plxtf --namespace=polyaxon
```

```bash
helm install del plxtf --purge
```
  
## Deploying/Deleting PytorchJob

In order to use Kubeflow as backend for running [distributed Pytorch experiments](/integrations/pytorchjob/), 
you need to deploy PytorchJob on the same namespace where Polyaxon was deployed

```bash
helm install polyaxon/pytorchjob --name=plxpytorch --namespace=polyaxon
```

```bash
helm install del plxpytorch --purge
```

## Deploying/Deleting MpiJob

In order to use Kubeflow as backend for running [distributed experiments using MPI](/integrations/mpijob/), 
you need to deploy PytorchJob on the same namespace where Polyaxon was deployed

```bash
helm install polyaxon/mpijob --name=plxmpi --namespace=polyaxon
```

```bash
helm install del plxmpi --purge
```
