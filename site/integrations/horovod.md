Polyaxon allows to schedule distributed Horovod experiments, and supports tracking metrics, outputs, and models.

## MPIJob Operator

Polyaxon provides support for Horovod via the [MPIJob Operator](/integrations/mpijob/). 
 
## Define the distributed topology

Please check the guide [Running Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod#running-horovod) for more details on how to set a Horovod experiment with MPI.
