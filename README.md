# polyaxon-kubeflow

Native support of Kubeflow operators in Polyaxon


## Description

This repo aims to provide a set of Helm charts, maintained and supported by Polyaxon, to easily deploy Kubeflow operators.

Polyaxon's Kubeflow integration supports as well running jobs directly on a Kubeflow deployment if it exists.

To learn mode about how you can easily switch backend for your distributed experiments, please look at the [integration page](https://docs.polyaxon.com/integrations/kubeflow/) in our documentation.
