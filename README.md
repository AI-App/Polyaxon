# polyaxon-quick-start

A quick start project for polyaxon.

This example is used for the quick start [section in the documentation](https://docs.polyaxon.com/quick_start/)

This example also includes different `polyaxonfiles`:

   * A simple polyaxonfile for running the default values in the model.py.
   * A polyaxonfile that defines the params in the declaration sections.
   * A polyaxonfile that defines declarations and a matrix, and will generate an experiment group for hyperparameters search.
