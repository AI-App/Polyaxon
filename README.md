# polyaxon-examples

Code for polyaxon tutorials and examples.

The code in this repo is used for training models on Polyaxon deployed on [Microsoft Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/).

The code in this repo is based on tensorflow/models, and trains and evaluate a CIFAR-10 ResNet model.

This repo also contains polyaxonfiles for training: single experiments, distributed experiments, and experiments with GPU.

The tutorial provides a step by step guide to:

 * [create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure](https://docs.polyaxon.com/tutorials/kubernetes_on_azure)
 * [create volumes for data and outputs on Azure](https://docs.polyaxon.com/tutorials/persistent_volumes)
 * [train experiments with Polyaxon](https://docs.polyaxon.com/tutorials/training_experiments_on_polyaxon)
