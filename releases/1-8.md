## v1.8.0 [WIP]

### CLI

 * **New**: `polyaxon run -MP` multi-params to provide several values.
   * Similar to `polyaxon run -P` but instead of passing a single param, it passes a sweep.
   * Creates multiple runs from the CLI.
   * **Note**: Advanced use-cases will still require creating a polyaxonfile with a `matrix` section.

### Core

 * **Enhancement**: Improve error response to be consumed correctly by the operator.

### UI

  * **New**: Add automatic notebook rendering in the artifacts tab.
  * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speed rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows.
  * **Enhancement**: Re-enable table widget in the dashboards tab.
  * **Enhancement**: Reorder flag filters based on their importance.

### Docs

 * **Enhancement**: Improve documentation for streamlit, tensorboard, commuter, notebook, jupyterlab, papermill, vscode.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve documentation for notifications.
 
### Deployment & Setup

 * **Deprecation**: Drop `notificationConnections` and only accept `connections`, please make sure to move all `notificationConnections` to the `connections` catalog.
   * `plugins.notifications` and `notificationConnections` were deprecated since several versions.
   * This change does not break or remove the logic for components using `plugins.notifications`, but the notifier connection is resolved directly from the `connections` catalog.
   * `plugins.notifications` will be completely removed once we push `hooks` to Polyaxon CE.

### Hub

 * **New**: Moved notifiers and tuners to the public hub.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add graph view for DAGs.
 * **New**: Add new "manager" role, the manager has similar capabilities as the "owner" role but does not have access to the billing view and APIs.
 * **New**: Add possibility to customize the full tuner component in hyper-optimization definition.
 * **Enhancement**: Add upstream/downstream to the RunQueryManager, to search all upstream/downstream runs `query=upstream:UUID` or `query=downstream.name:NAME` 
 * **Enhancement**: Improve archive/restore runs.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve buttons shown to users for performing actions based on their roles.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve spaces deletion and recovery.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve several admin forms.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve members and teams forms.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve members table actions.
 * **Enhancement**: Add two new tabs to the team details view to show components and models accessible by a team similar to the projects tab.
 * **Enhancement**: Always sync the organization's settings to reduce confusion and avoid manual refresh when performing admin activities on the organization level.
 * **Enhancement**: Resolve tuners and notifiers operations from the public component hub.
 * **Fix**: Issue with archive run API erroneously changes the run status.
