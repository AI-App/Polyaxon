## v1.5.1 [WIP]

### Core

 * **Enhancement**: Improve type checking and allow compatible types.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow opting out of type checks by using the type `ANY`.
 * **Fix**: Regression in init artifacts container for mount paths.
 * **Fix**: Bug with `container.env`. Values containing `int` are casted. e.g. `value: "1"`.

### Docs

 * **New**: Add new how-tos section to document recurrent use-cases and frequent questions about leveraging Kubernetes abstractions in Polyaxon.
 * **New**: Add new guide about conditional scheduling. 
 * **New**: Add new guide about manual/human approval.
 * **New**: Add new guide about operations caching.
 * **New**: Add more information about the compiler and variables resolution in the context section.
 * **Fix**: Typos.
 
### Commercial

 * **Enhancement**: Allow requesting all inputs, outputs, artifacts as dictionaries without specifying values by keys.
  
## v1.5.0

### Core

 * **Enhancement**: Allow to specify path from and path to in the init artifacts specification.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve restart with copy mode, the artifacts are now initialized under the new run.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve several APIs response time.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow passing variables to the concurrency key in matrix algorithms and dag.
 * **Enhancement**: Add `uuid` type parser and validator to the V1IO.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve mount path for artifacts connections in init containers.
 * **Enhancement**: Remove restriction on parameters with `contextOnly` and `toInit`.
 * **Enhancement**: Use `-R` instead of `-r` for recursive copy, a regression was introduced when the base image was updated.
 * **Fix**: Issue in init container logs when the artifacts are coming from the default artifacts store.
 * **Fix**: Typos in protos files.

### UI

 * **Enhancement**: Use ellipsis, `...`, when a filter is very long.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve the overview headers to use a smaller fonts for titles/names to not break the page when the entity name is long.
 * **Enhancement**: The comparison table shows a list of default columns based on the kind, for instance it will include the concurrency and runtime for Matrix runs.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve edit filter by adding a spaces after `:` and between operators like `|` and `~`.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve and consolidate tables padding.
 * **Fix**: Issue with search input not allowing spaces.

### Operator

 * **Enhancement**: Upgrade operator:
   * Use latest stable apimachinery.
   * Use latest stable k8s client-go.
   * Use latest stable controller-runtime.

### Hub

 * **Enhancement**: Add new Tensorboard version with upstream lineage.
 * **Enhancement**: Add new Tensorboard version with performance based join.
 * **Enhancement**: Move notification component to component hub.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve Slack notifier to send extra information, such as inputs, outputs, and custom information. 

### House Keeping

 * **Enhancement**: Upgrade go version.

### Docs

 * **Enhancement**: Move context docs to a separate section.
 * **Fix**: Typos.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add `Join` and `JoinParam` specifications. As opposed to the `matrix` section which allows to parallelize operations using hyperparameter tuning or mapping, the `joins` section allows:
   * to filter, aggregate, and annotate inputs/outputs/artifacts from multiple or parallel upstream runs based on query/sort/limit/offset specification.
   * to initialize an operation with all artifacts from several upstream runs dynamically.
 * **New**: Implement logic for internal `events`. Users can now run full event based workflows, and in future iterations, it will be possible to start operations based on external events and internal alerts.
 * **New**: Implement logic for `hooks`. Hooks can be used: 
   * to send webhooks
   * to send notifications and alerts to slack, discord, github, ...
   * to integrate with external systems
   * to initiate a test/eval operation after training.
   * ...
 * **New**: Add new lineage tabs for: connections, actions & hooks, upstream/downstream runs.
 * **Enhancement**: Expose namespace and artifacts store connection used on the run overview page.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow filtering runs by the artifacts store connection name used.  
 * **Enhancement**: Use `globals.*` for requesting `uuid`, `name`, `status` and other general values from upstream operations, similar to normal operation context to have more consistent interface.
 * **Enhancement**: Add several heartbeat processes to clean distressed pipelines and runs.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve auditing and activity logs.
 * **Enhancement**: Optimize events access to the database.
 * **Enhancement**: Mark operations with false conditions as `skipped` instead of `failed`.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve the run edge collection logic to conserve metadata, types, and reference.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve the agent controller's querying logic and traversal speed.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve schedules reconciliation by flagging all runs on schedule to avoid race conditions.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve connections compilation.
 * **Fix**: Issue with pipelines getting two final states (`stopped` and then `succeeded`).
 * **Fix**: Issue with agent controller not scheduling DAGs and Matrix when a schedule is attached.
 * **Fix**: Issue when a schedule is attached to a matrix, the metadata is missing and the matrix icon not showing in the sidebar.  
 * **Fix**: Issue with schedule not stopping properly and keep scheduling new runs.
