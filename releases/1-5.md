## v1.5.0 [WIP]

### Core

 * **Enhancement**: Allow to specify path from and path to in the init artifacts specification.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve restart with copy mode, the artifacts are now initialized under the new run.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve several APIs response time.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow passing variables to the concurrency key in matrix algorithms and dag. 

### UI

 * **Enhancement**: Use ellipsis, `...`, when a filter is very long.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve the overview headers to use a smaller fonts for titles/names to not break the page when the entity name is long.
 * **Fix**: Issue with search input not allowing spaces.

### Operator

 * **Enhancement**: Upgrade operator:
   * Use latest stable apimachinery.
   * Use latest stable k8s client-go.
   * Use latest stable controller-runtime.

### Hub

 * **Enhancement**: Add new Tensorboard version with upstream lineage.
 * **Enhancement**: Add new Tensorboard version with performance based join.  

### House Keeping

 * **Enhancement**: Upgrade go version.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add `Join` and `JoinParam` specifications. As opposed to the `matrix` section which allows to parallelize operations using hyperparameter tuning or mapping, the `joins` section allows:
   * to filter, aggregate, and annotate inputs/outputs/artifacts from multiple or parallel upstream runs based on query/sort/limit specification.
   * to initialize an operation with all artifacts from several upstream runs dynamically.
 * **New**: Implement logic for internal `events`. Users can now run full event based workflows, and in future iterations, it will be possible to start operations based on external events and internal alerts.
 * **New**: Implement logic for `hooks`. Hooks can be used: 
   * to send webhooks
   * to send notifications and alerts to slack, discord, github, ...
   * to integrate with external systems
   * to initiate a test/eval operation after training.
   * ...
 * **Enhancement**: Use `globals.*` for requesting `uuis`, `name`, `status` and other general values from upstream operations, similar to normal operation context to have more consistent interface.
 * **Enhancement**: Add several heartbeat processes to clean distressed pipelines and runs.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve auditing and activity logs.
 * **Enhancement**: Optimize events access to the database.
 * **Enhancement**: Mark operations with false conditions as `skipped` instead of `failed`.
 * **Fix**: Pipelines getting two final states (`stopped` and then `succeeded`).
