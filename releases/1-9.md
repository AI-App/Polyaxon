## v1.9.0 [WIP]

### CLI

 * **New**: `polyaxon run -MP` multi-params to provide several values.
   * Similar to `polyaxon run -P` but instead of passing a single param, it passes a sweep.
   * Creates multiple runs from the CLI.
   * **Note**: Advanced use-cases will still require creating a polyaxonfile with a `matrix` section.

### Tracking

 * **New**: Add flag `is_series` with default `True` to `log_metric(s)` to allow users to log single metric without creating an event file.

### UI

 * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speed rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows and the logs table.
 * **Fix**: Some typos in forms and modals.
 
### Docs

 * **Enhancement**: Add a matrix table with actions and user' roles to improve understanding of what users can and cannot do.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add status to early stopping strategies to allow users to define what status should be used when an early stopping condition is met, default value will stay the same `stopped`.
 * **Enhancement**: Add `deletion in progress` indicator to the overview pages to reduce the confusion
    when a user deletes a run or project and then goes again to the overview page of that same entity.
 * **Enhancement**: Add `is locked` indicator to runs linked to a model version in the model registry to reduce confusion.
 * **Enhancement**: Add documentation links to the members and teams management modal to allow `Owners` and `Managers` to quickly view what each role can and cannot do.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve UI pipeline progress indicator to reflect the final status of the runs managed by the pipeline, currently it shows a green progress line.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to batch cleaning operations in a single job based on the artifacts store.
   * This should avoid overwhelming cluster(s) where the agent is running.
 * **Enhancement**: Add missing restore buttons on settings page for project/component hub/model registry.
 * **Enhancement**: Add project definition customization to the settings page.
   * Admins can select runtimes to allow on a specific project.
 * **Enhancement**: Add pre-delete check to better handle runs waiting for the cached results and queue them for actual computation.
