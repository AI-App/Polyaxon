## v1.14.0

> This minor release is a WIP.

### Agent

 * **New**: (Beta) Add cluster and namespace monitoring:
   * Show nodes's states and health.
   * Show nodes's CPU/Memory/GPU consumption.

### CLI

 * **New**: Add `polyaxon ops shell` command similar to the shell tab.

### Sidecar

 * **Enhancement**: Improve the artifacts syncing logic to be more resilient to failed requests or intermittent errors. 

### Specification

 * **New**: (Beta) Multi-container pipeline orchestration in a single operation.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow setting DAG outputs without the SDK/Client.

### Core

 * **New**: Add support for annotations in the connections specification.
 * **Enhancement**: Enforce sampling and only keep a maximum of 10k entries per event.

### UI

 * **New**: Add operation status color indicator to the page's favicon.
 * **New**: Add markdown, scalar, summary, lineage, and performance widgets.
 * **New**: Add Metrics/Params correlation and importance.
 * **New**: Add new advanced filters, allow filtering the runs in the comparison table based on:
   * parallel coordinate.
   * histogram.
   * activity calendar.
   * custom visualizations.
 * **New**: Allow comparing resources with metrics and cross runs resources.
 * **New**: Add predefined hyperparameter tuning widgets/visualizations.
 * **New**: Allow inspecting charts and showing the data used.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve UI to support redirection to the original page after authentication.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow visualizing multiple images (index range) at the same time.
 * **Enhancement**: Implement lazy loading of widgets in dashboards based on their visibility in viewport.

 * **Enhancement**: Expose node scheduling (node selector, affinity, and tolerations) per-service.
 * **Enhancement**: Only support offline mode for serving assets.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add global search (cmd + k), a single global search field to provide easy access to:
   * Projects
   * Models
   * Components
   * Connections
   * Operations
 * **New**: Add notification center to allow users to control and manage notifications using the UI.
 * **New**: Add selection reports, this is similar to selection in v0 but the new implementation will support all the new features and dashboard flexibility (events, artifacts, lineages, comparison, custom columns selection, multi-field sorting, ...):
   * Allows adding single runs to a report from the run's overview page.
   * Allows adding multiple runs to a report using a multi-run action.
   * Add project sidebar button `Reports`.
   * Allow running downstream-ops for a report, e.g. multi-run Tensorboard.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to save searches on the global runs table.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to save custom analytics searches.
 * **Enhancement**: Add more informative messages and handling when scaling down usage/agents/seats or when downgrading to a plan missing a specific feature.
 * **Enhancement**: Add support for resuming pipelines and matrix operations.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve resuming or restarting an operation that is part of a pipeline.
 * **Enhancement**: Investigate the new `suspend` feature to provide immediate concurrency change instead of the current [draining logic](/faq/How-does-changing-concurrency-work/).
 * **Fix**: Regression in metric early stopping policies.
