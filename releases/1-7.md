## v1.7.0 [WIP]

### UI

  * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speed rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows.
  * **New**: Add automatic notebook rendering in the artifacts tab.

### Tracking

 * **New**: Auto-logging capabilities.

### Operator

 * **Enhancement**: Update CRD to `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`.
   * The CustomResourceDefinition API type is promoted to `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` since K8s 1.16.
   * A flag is provided `operator.useCRDV1Beta1` to keep the previous behaviour.

### Deployment & Setup
 
 * **Enhancement**: Add `operator.useCRDV1Beta1` flag to force deploying with v1beta1 and to preserve compatibility with k8s cluster <= 1.15.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add graph view for DAGs.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve hyperparameter tuning pipelines.
